;;
;;  SETTING UP A NETWORK SERVER
;;

;; The server must allow some kind of login, and then that
;; login session has to be hooked up to users of various kinds,
;; then I guess we can just let it rip.



;; This is what I want
;; (defun run-as-server () 
;;   (let ((server (port:open-socket-server 4141)))
;;     (loop
     
;;      ;; Listen for incoming connections
;;      (let ((socket (socket-accept server)))
       
;;        ;; Spawn a process to handle the connection
;;        (make-process "Connection handler"
;;                      #'handle-connection
;;                      socket))
     
;;      ;; The main process is now free to accept a new connection
;;      )))

;; This is what I need to do in clisp
